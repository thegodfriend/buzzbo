A mod that buffs Hive Knight, and also adds in some other nice touches, such as new Dreamnail dialogue.

UPDATE 0.4.2.0: In the previous version, spikes were spawned, in some cases, between five and ten times more than they were meant to "due to a coding bug" (i.e. me not realising I'm spawning spikes faster than there are frames, unless you happen to run at 500FPS). This was fixed and now Buzzbo spawns spikes at an underwhelming rate of 12 sets per second during the dash, instead of, say, 70.

=========================

This is my very first mod, and it clearly shows. Unbalanced, messy code, and, if I'm being entirely honest, missing a couple features due to lack of experience.

I have two main things I want to update in the future, although I'm not sure if V2 will be major enough to deserve its own public release. These two updates will, though, be in the FAR, far future.

This mod is intended to be a part of the Hallow Knight project, in which I plan to remake as much as I can in Hollow Knight. Note usage of "plan to" instead of "will". I have no idea how far I'll go before giving up, heh.

Thanks to my three playtesters, two of which repeatedly complained it was too easy. One of them almost got me to remove the staggers, but luckily for all of you, the staggers are important lore-wise, so they stayed.
UPDATE: Even more thanks to them, cuz without their help I probably never would have noticed the spike spawn rate issue.

Big thanks to all those in HK's #modding-development channel, including but not limited to [insert all of you here, the list was getting long and I was scared of forgetting anyone so this is better]. I don't actually remember who helped me but hell all of you were incredibly supportive so thanks to all of you.

And big thanks to everyone in the Hallow Knight discord, who all are super hyped about this project and make everything so much more fun. I'm sorry I'm leaving you all waiting for the next mod, I just HAD to fix some ridiculous things here.
